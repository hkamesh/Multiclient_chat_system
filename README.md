# 🧩 Multi-Client Chat System using Sockets & Threads

A real-time chat application built with Python that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate through a centralized server. This project demonstrates core concepts in computer networks, operating systems, concurrent programming, and inter-process communication (IPC).

---

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time messaging between multiple clients
- Centralized server handling all connections
- Concurrent handling of clients using Python threads
- Command-line based interface for simplicity
- Graceful client disconnection and error handling

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Socket Programming** – TCP/IP-based client-server architecture  
- **Multithreading** – Each client is handled in a separate thread  
- **Concurrency** – Simultaneous read/write without blocking  
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** – Simulated via network sockets  
- **Operating System Integration** – Working with low-level OS interfaces (threads & ports)
